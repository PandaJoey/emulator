Timer:
The timer in the gameboy has a selectable frequency in hertz for interupts these are
4096
16384
65536
262144
These frequencies increment the (TIMA) timer counter. when it overflows, it generates an interupt.
It is then loaded with the contents of the (TMA) timer modulo below are examples:

This interval timer interrupts 4096 times per second:
    ld a,-1
    ld ($FF06),a ;Set TMA to divide clock by 1
    ld a,4
    ld ($FF07),a ;Set clock to 4096 Hertz

This interval timer interrupts 65536 times per second
    ld a,-4
    ld ($FF06),a ;Set TMA to divide clock by 4
    ld a,5
    ld ($FF07),a ;Set clock to 262144 Hertz
