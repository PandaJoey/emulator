Sound:
Two channels connected to output terminals S01 s02, One input terminal connected to the cartridge.
the input can be routed to either or both outputs, there are 4 ways to produce sounds:

Quadrangular wave patterns with sweep and envelope functions. 
Quadrangular wave patterns with envelope functions. 
Voluntary wave patterns from wave RAM.
White noise with an envelope function.

These can be controlled independantly and mixed spereratly for each output also sound registers 
can be set at all times while they are producing sounds.

When setting the initial value of the envelope and restarting the length counter, set the initial 
flag to 1 and initialize the data:

Under the following situations the Sound ON flag is reset and the sound output stops:
1. When the sound output is stopped by the length counter.
2. When overflow occurs at the addition mode while sweep is operating at sound 1.

When the (Sound OFF) flag for sound 3 (bit 7 of NR30) is set at 0, the cancellation of the OFF
mode must be done by setting the sound OFF flag to 1. By initializing sound 3, 
it starts it's function.

When the (All Sound OFF) flag (bit 7 of NR52) is set to 0, the mode registers for sounds 1,2,3, 
and 4 are reset and the sound output stops. (NOTE: The setting of each sounds mode register 
must be done after the (All Sound OFF) mode is cancelled. During the (All Sound OFF)mode, each 
sound mode register cannot be set.)

using no sound reduces power by 16% again probably not relivant to us.

*****IMPORTANT*****
These tend to be the two most important equations in converting between Hertz and GB frequency 
registers: (Sounds will have a 2.4% higher frequency on SuperGB.)
gb = 2048 - (131072 / Hz)
Hz = 131072 / (2048 - gb)
